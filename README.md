# ESP32C3 Zig Clay Example

Exploration of both integrating Zig code with the IDF backbone as well as using Clay to generate UI that is sent out via SPI to a display.

The code is initially based off of an IDF example to send an image via SPI to a display.

This WIP and doesn't work yet.

## TODOs
[] - Fix all truetypes errors

[] - Properly embed truetype code with clay

[] - Refactor code, code is very very messy at the moment

[] - Create new build target for debugging and developing UI, requires separating existing code into several files.

[] - Write documention

[] - Write README
